<p>Brenda Barnett, out of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette:<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, [State Senator Jeremy] Hutchinson became interested in arming school personnel, he said. He was invited to attend an &ldquo;active shooter&rdquo; training and - using a rubber bullet-loaded pistol - he mistakenly shot a teacher who was confronting a &ldquo;bad guy.&rdquo;<&#47;p><br />
