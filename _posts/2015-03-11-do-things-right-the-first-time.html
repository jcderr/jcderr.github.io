<blockquote>
<p>Most postmortem blog posts are teary affairs explaining how something went wildly wrong and how this will not happen again, but we think postmortems are useful for any major change, whether a success or failure. It's great to learn from mistakes, but it's also useful to learn from successes that demonstrate due diligence to the only true shortcut: Do things right the first time.<&#47;p><br />
