<blockquote>
<p>With this test in hand, you can start bisecting your code. Remember you must have two commits: one where you're sure the bug exists and one where you're sure that the bug does not exist. You can use hashes and tags to point to these commits. When you bisect you mark a commit as good (the test passes) or bad (the test fails).</p><br />

<p>I've fallen out of the habit of using <code>git bisect</code>. I can't even tell you why, because it's that awesome. After being reminded of it, I'm going to make an effort to use it more frequently.</p></p>
