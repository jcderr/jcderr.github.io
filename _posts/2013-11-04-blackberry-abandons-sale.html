<p>If you're surprised by this, you haven't been paying attention. BlackBerry, as a company, has absolutely nothing to offer anyone at this point. They don't have any substantial short term upsides, long term upsides, or even any meaningful assets aside from a marginal patent library, and the industry is already becoming weary of patent battles.</p></p>
