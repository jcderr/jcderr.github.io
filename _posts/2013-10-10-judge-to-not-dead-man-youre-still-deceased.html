<p>From Lowering the Bar:<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I don't know where that leaves you," the judge told him, "but you're still deceased as far as the law is concerned."<&#47;p><br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>If you go missing for 19 years and Ohio declares you deceased, you can't just show up alive. Even if you are.<&#47;p></p>
