<p>Marc Scott:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you teach IT or Computing, this is a phrase that you&rsquo;ll have heard a million times, a billion times, epsilon zero times, aleph one times. Okay I exaggerate, but you&rsquo;ll have heard it a lot. There are variants of the phrase, all espousing today&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s technical ability. My favourite is from parents: &lsquo;Oh, Johnny will be a natural for A-Level Computing. He&rsquo;s always on his computer at home.&rsquo; The parents seem to have some vague concept that spending hours each evening on Facebook and YouTube will impart, by some sort of cybernetic osmosis, a knowledge of PHP, HTML, JavaScript and Haskell.</p><br />

<p>'Computing' is a universe unto itself. No one, no matter how 'geeky', is good at everything computer related. There's a difference between computer literacy ('I can sit down at a computer and use it') and software engineering ('I can write new software using a programming language') and even software design ('I can determine how a new piece of software should behave'). When we're creating software, it isn't just a bunch of computer geeks in a room together who somehow make it happen. The team must be diverse; we're all geeks, but with different skill sets. You might see us as 'computer geeks,' but in reality I'm an operations geek, while my co-works range from math and science geeks to art geeks and everything in between.</p></p>
