<p>After a brief stint in Europe, former Houston Aero Jon DiSalvatore signed with the Syracuse Crunch. Growing up going to games at the Summit during their IHL games, I always had a soft spot for the Aeros even after the advent of my home town Texas Stars here in Austin. The two teams developed quite the rivalry until the Aeros moved to Iowa this year, and DiSalvatore was always right in the thick of it.<&#47;p></p>
<p>In 36 career games against Texas, he has posted 26 points (13 goals, 13 assists), including 6 power play tallies and a game winner. He has been a real Star-killer. While it's good to see him back in North America, I'm more than a little relieved that he signed in the Eastern Conference; Texas won't see Syracuse unless both make it to the Calder Cup Finals.<&#47;p></p>
