<p>From Commodore himself:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Head coach Scott Arniel] was jealous because he played a lot of years, he had a wife and kids and he felt he didn't earn a lot of money so he booted me off the team.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>Next he'll be complaining about Arniel's kids crying in the night.</p></p>
