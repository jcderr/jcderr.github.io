<p>Chuck Gormley reports for CSNWashington:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capitals general manager George McPhee said he thought Tom Wilson&rsquo;s second period hit on Flyers center Brayden Schenn was &ldquo;a great hit&rdquo; and that Schenn was &ldquo;too slow&rdquo; to get out of the way.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>Adam Oates added:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He hit him hard, yeah. To me, it&rsquo;s a clean hit. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a penalty at all.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/capitals-wilson-ejected-light-speed-boarding-brayden-schenn-025816294--nhl.html">Here's the hit in question</a>. It's very clearly <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26329">Boarding</a> and <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26331">Charging</a>, and potentially <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26333">Checking from Behind</a>, all rolled into one. It's not a clean hit, it's not a good play, and Oates, McPhee, and other Caps seeking to excuse Wilson should be ashamed of themselves.</p></p>
<p>I can buy that maybe Checking from Behind isn't a perfect fit, per the rule:</p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a player intentionally turns his body to create contact with his back, no penalty shall be assessed.</p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>However, the onus is on Wilson to deliver a legal body check, and he's charging far too fast, especially given the proximity to the boards, to adjust to any changes in direction or facing by Schenn.</p></p>
<p>Wilson faces a phone interview with the DPS, so he won't be suspended for more than 5 games. And that's just a shame; this is exactly the kind of play that the NHL should be <a href="http://continuously.me/2013/12/18/nhl-must-change/">removing from the game entirely</a>.</p></p>
