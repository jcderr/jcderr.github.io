<p>Continuously Me is written and produced by Jeremy Derr.<&#47;p></p>
<p>I am Director of Platform Engineering and Site Reliability for an Austine-based startup. My previous lives have included stints as DevOps Engineer, QA Manager, cofounder of mobile chat service Grackl, small business owner, and a member of the Original Geniuses - the first generation of Apple's Mac Genius corps.<&#47;p></p>
<p>I write a lot of shell scripts and Python. I speak fluent YAML and JSON. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;docker.com&#47;">Docker<&#47;a> is the new hotness, and I'm all over it. I live, speak, eat, and breath <a href="http:&#47;&#47;aws.amazon.com&#47;">Amazon Web Services<&#47;a> automation. If you're not using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;aws.amazon.com&#47;cloudformation&#47;">CloudFormation<&#47;a>, you're almost certainly doing it wrong.<&#47;p></p>
